<div>
	<p>
		Since the 1960s, iguanas have been popping everywhere in South Florida.  Sometimes they're great to see, but often times, they can be a big problem.
		This app allows you to report sightings to this site.  Just take a picture on your mobile device, post it, and it'll be added to the database.
	</p>

	<p>Just follow these simple steps:</p>
	<div class="stepsImages">
		<h4>Take a picture of the iguana.</h4>
		<img role="img" aria-label="Take a picture of the iguana with your mobile device" class="img-fluid" src="~/images/Take-Picture-Step.jpg" alt="First Step"/>

		<h4>Select the image and upload it to the form.</h4>
		<img role="img" aria-label="Go to Iguana Tracker web site and select the image and fill out the form." class="img-fluid" src="~/images/Upload-step.jpg" alt="Second step"/>

		<h4>Then click on the upload button.</h4>
		<img role="img" aria-label="Upload the image by clicking on the upload button." class="img-fluid" src="~/images/Submit-buttons.jpg" alt="Third Step"/>
