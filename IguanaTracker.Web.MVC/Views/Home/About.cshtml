<h1>About</h1>
<div>
	<p>
		Since the 1960s, iguanas have been popping everywhere in South Florida.  Sometimes they're great to see, but often times, they can be a big problem.
		This app allows users to report sightings to this site.  They take a picture on their mobile device, post it, and it'll be added to the database.
		Feel free to post on sightings here.
	</p>

	<p>Just follow these simple steps:</p>
	<div class="stepsImages">
		<p>Take a picture of the iguana.</p>
		<img src="~/images/Take-Picture-Step.jpg" />

		<p>Select the image and upload it to the form.</p>
		<img src="~/images/Upload-step.jpg" />

		<p>Then click on the upload button.</p>
		<img src="~/images/Submit-buttons.jpg" />
